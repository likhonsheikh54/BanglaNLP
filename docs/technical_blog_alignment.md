# The Hybrid Alignment Algorithm Behind BanglaNLP

*By Likhon Sheikh, Creator of BanglaNLP*

## Introduction

Parallel corpora are the foundation of modern cross-lingual NLP applications, particularly machine translation. Yet creating high-quality parallel datasets for language pairs like Bengali-English presents unique challenges that conventional alignment approaches struggle to address. In this technical deep dive, I'll share the innovative hybrid alignment algorithm we developed for BanglaNLP, which achieves 92% alignment accuracy on our test setâ€”significantly outperforming traditional methods.

## The Challenge: Why Bengali-English Alignment is Difficult

Before diving into our solution, it's important to understand what makes Bengali-English alignment particularly challenging:

1. **Structural Divergence**: Bengali and English belong to different language families (Indo-Aryan vs. Germanic) with fundamentally different syntax and word order.

2. **Morphological Complexity**: Bengali is morphologically richer than English, often expressing through inflection what English expresses with multiple words.

3. **Source Text Variations**: News organizations frequently don't provide direct translations but adapt content for different audiences, resulting in significant rewording and restructuring.

4. **Length Disparities**: Bengali often requires fewer words to express the same content, making length-based alignment methods unreliable.

5. **Named Entity Variations**: Transliteration of names varies widely, making entity matching difficult.

Conventional approaches like Gale-Church (length-based) or dictionary-based methods yield poor results under these conditions, typically achieving only 60-70% accuracy on our test data.

## Our Hybrid Approach

Our alignment algorithm combines three complementary techniques:

1. **Statistical Features**
2. **Semantic Embeddings**
3. **Contextual Information**

Let's examine each component in detail.

### 1. Statistical Features

While traditional statistical approaches alone are insufficient, they provide valuable signals when combined with other methods. We extract several statistical features:

#### Length Ratio Analysis

We compute the character length ratio between potential Bengali-English sentence pairs, but with a language-specific calibration. Through analysis of thousands of correctly aligned pairs, we established that Bengali sentences typically contain ~0.8x the number of characters of their English counterparts (with significant variance).

```python
def compute_length_ratio(bn_sentence, en_sentence):
    # Adjusted for typical Bengali-English ratio
    bn_length = len(bn_sentence)
    en_length = len(en_sentence)
    expected_ratio = 0.8
    actual_ratio = bn_length / en_length if en_length > 0 else float('inf')
    
    # How close the ratio is to the expected ratio (1.0 is perfect)
    ratio_score = min(actual_ratio / expected_ratio, expected_ratio / actual_ratio)
    return ratio_score
```

#### Numerical Entity Preservation

Numbers are typically preserved across translations, making them valuable alignment anchors. We extract and compare numerical entities between sentences:

```python
def compute_numerical_preservation(bn_sentence, en_sentence):
    # Extract numbers from both sentences
    bn_numbers = extract_numbers(bn_sentence)
    en_numbers = extract_numbers(en_sentence)
    
    if not bn_numbers and not en_numbers:
        return 1.0  # No numbers in either sentence
    
    if not bn_numbers or not en_numbers:
        return 0.0  # Numbers in one but not the other
    
    # Compute Jaccard similarity between number sets
    intersection = len(set(bn_numbers).intersection(set(en_numbers)))
    union = len(set(bn_numbers).union(set(en_numbers)))
    return intersection / union
```

The function `extract_numbers()` handles both Bengali and English numerals, including their variations.

#### Named Entity Matching

We implemented a specialized named entity recognition system that handles transliteration variations between Bengali and English:

```python
def compute_entity_similarity(bn_sentence, en_sentence):
    # Extract named entities
    bn_entities = extract_entities(bn_sentence, lang='bn')
    en_entities = extract_entities(en_sentence, lang='en')
    
    if not bn_entities and not en_entities:
        return 1.0  # No entities in either sentence
    
    if not bn_entities or not en_entities:
        return 0.0  # Entities in one but not the other
    
    # Compute similarities with transliteration awareness
    similarity_matrix = np.zeros((len(bn_entities), len(en_entities)))
    
    for i, bn_entity in enumerate(bn_entities):
        for j, en_entity in enumerate(en_entities):
            similarity_matrix[i, j] = transliteration_similarity(bn_entity, en_entity)
    
    # Use Hungarian algorithm to find optimal matching
    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(-similarity_matrix)
    return similarity_matrix[row_ind, col_ind].mean()
```

The function `transliteration_similarity()` uses sound-based matching and common Bengali-English transliteration patterns.

### 2. Semantic Embeddings

The core innovation in our approach is leveraging recent advances in cross-lingual embeddings to capture semantic similarities across languages.

#### Cross-lingual Sentence Embeddings

We utilize the Language Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding (LaBSE) model, which is trained on 109 languages including Bengali. This model maps sentences from different languages into a shared embedding space where translations are close to each other:

```python
def compute_semantic_similarity(bn_sentences, en_sentences, model):
    # Encode all sentences at once for efficiency
    bn_embeddings = model.encode(bn_sentences)
    en_embeddings = model.encode(en_sentences)
    
    # Normalize embeddings
    bn_embeddings = bn_embeddings / np.linalg.norm(bn_embeddings, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    en_embeddings = en_embeddings / np.linalg.norm(en_embeddings, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    
    # Compute cosine similarity matrix
    similarity_matrix = np.dot(bn_embeddings, en_embeddings.T)
    return similarity_matrix
```

However, we found that LaBSE alone can sometimes be misled by sentences that are thematically similar but not translations of each other. To address this, we fine-tuned the model on a small set of manually verified Bengali-English translations, which improved accuracy by approximately 7%.

### 3. Contextual Information

The final component of our approach is leveraging paragraph-level context to resolve ambiguous alignments.

#### Paragraph Boundary Detection

We first identify paragraph boundaries in the source document using a combination of visual cues (newlines, indentation) and semantic coherence measures.

#### Paragraph-level Alignment

Before aligning individual sentences, we align paragraphs using a coarse-grained version of our hybrid approach:

```python
def align_paragraphs(bn_paragraphs, en_paragraphs):
    # Compute paragraph similarity matrix using our hybrid approach
    similarity_matrix = compute_paragraph_similarity(bn_paragraphs, en_paragraphs)
    
    # Use dynamic programming to find optimal alignment path
    alignments = find_optimal_alignment_path(similarity_matrix)
    return alignments
```

#### Constrained Sentence Alignment

Once paragraphs are aligned, we perform sentence alignment within each paragraph pair, which significantly reduces the search space and improves accuracy:

```python
def align_sentences_with_context(aligned_paragraphs, bn_sentences, en_sentences):
    all_aligned_sentences = []
    
    for bn_para_idx, en_para_idx in aligned_paragraphs:
        # Get sentences in these paragraphs
        bn_para_sentences = get_sentences_in_paragraph(bn_sentences, bn_para_idx)
        en_para_sentences = get_sentences_in_paragraph(en_sentences, en_para_idx)
        
        # Align sentences within this paragraph pair
        aligned_sentences = align_sentences(
            bn_para_sentences, 
            en_para_sentences
        )
        
        all_aligned_sentences.extend(aligned_sentences)
    
    return all_aligned_sentences
```

## Putting It All Together

Our final alignment algorithm combines these three approaches using a weighted ensemble method. The weights were optimized using a small development set of manually aligned sentence pairs:

```python
def hybrid_alignment_score(bn_sentence, en_sentence, context=None):
    # Compute individual scores
    statistical_score = compute_statistical_score(bn_sentence, en_sentence)
    semantic_score = compute_semantic_score(bn_sentence, en_sentence)
    context_score = compute_context_score(bn_sentence, en_sentence, context) if context else 0.5
    
    # Weighted combination
    final_score = (
        0.25 * statistical_score + 
        0.55 * semantic_score + 
        0.20 * context_score
    )
    
    return final_score
```

We found that giving more weight to semantic scores provides the best overall performance, but all three components contribute significantly to the final accuracy.

## Dynamic Programming for Optimal Alignment

With our scoring function in place, we use dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment path between sentence sequences:

```python
def find_optimal_alignment(bn_sentences, en_sentences, context=None):
    # Initialize score matrix
    n, m = len(bn_sentences), len(en_sentences)
    score_matrix = np.zeros((n+1, m+1))
    backpointer = np.zeros((n+1, m+1, 2), dtype=int)
    
    # Fill first row and column with gap penalties
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        score_matrix[i, 0] = score_matrix[i-1, 0] - 0.3
        backpointer[i, 0] = [i-1, 0]
    
    for j in range(1, m+1):
        score_matrix[0, j] = score_matrix[0, j-1] - 0.3
        backpointer[0, j] = [0, j-1]
    
    # Fill score matrix
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            # Calculate score for aligning i with j
            align_score = score_matrix[i-1, j-1] + hybrid_alignment_score(
                bn_sentences[i-1], 
                en_sentences[j-1], 
                context
            )
            
            # Calculate score for skipping i
            skip_bn_score = score_matrix[i-1, j] - 0.3
            
            # Calculate score for skipping j
            skip_en_score = score_matrix[i, j-1] - 0.3
            
            # Choose highest score
            if align_score >= skip_bn_score and align_score >= skip_en_score:
                score_matrix[i, j] = align_score
                backpointer[i, j] = [i-1, j-1]
            elif skip_bn_score >= skip_en_score:
                score_matrix[i, j] = skip_bn_score
                backpointer[i, j] = [i-1, j]
            else:
                score_matrix[i, j] = skip_en_score
                backpointer[i, j] = [i, j-1]
    
    # Traceback to find alignment path
    alignments = []
    i, j = n, m
    
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        prev_i, prev_j = backpointer[i, j]
        
        # If both changed, we have an alignment
        if i - prev_i == 1 and j - prev_j == 1:
            alignments.append((i-1, j-1))
        
        i, j = prev_i, prev_j
    
    # Reverse to get alignments in correct order
    return list(reversed(alignments))
```

This algorithm handles one-to-one alignments as well as cases where sentences in one language have no counterpart in the other (gaps).

## Evaluation and Results

We evaluated our hybrid alignment approach against several baselines on a test set of 1,000 manually aligned Bengali-English sentence pairs from news articles:

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Gale-Church (length-based) | 0.63 | 0.59 | 0.61 |
| Dictionary-based | 0.71 | 0.68 | 0.69 |
| LaBSE embeddings only | 0.83 | 0.79 | 0.81 |
| Statistical + LaBSE | 0.88 | 0.84 | 0.86 |
| **Our Hybrid Approach** | **0.94** | **0.90** | **0.92** |

The results demonstrate that our hybrid approach substantially outperforms traditional methods and even the strong baseline of using LaBSE embeddings alone.

## Applications Beyond Bengali

While developed for Bengali-English alignment, our approach generalizes well to other language pairs with similar challenges, particularly those with:

1. Different writing systems
2. Significant structural divergence
3. Limited parallel data for training

Preliminary experiments with Hindi-English and Tamil-English show promising results, with F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.87 respectively.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The hybrid alignment algorithm presented here has enabled us to create a high-quality Bengali-English parallel corpus of over 120,000 sentence pairs, significantly advancing the state of Bengali NLP resources. Our approach demonstrates that combining statistical features, cross-lingual embeddings, and contextual information can effectively address the challenges of aligning distant language pairs.

Future work will focus on three areas:

1. **Scaling to more diverse sources**: Adapting the algorithm to handle literary and technical content beyond news articles.
2. **One-to-many alignments**: Improving handling of cases where one sentence in one language corresponds to multiple sentences in the other.
3. **End-to-end integration**: Tighter coupling between scraping, alignment, and filtering for a fully automated pipeline.

We believe our approach contributes valuable techniques to the field of parallel corpus creation for low-resource languages and hope it inspires similar efforts for other underrepresented languages.
