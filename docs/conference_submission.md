# BanglaNLP: A Large-Scale Bengali-English Parallel Corpus from News Sources

## Abstract

We present BanglaNLP, a comprehensive toolkit and the largest open-source Bengali-English parallel corpus derived from news sources. Despite being the 7th most spoken language globally with over 230 million speakers, Bengali remains severely underrepresented in Natural Language Processing research due to the scarcity of high-quality parallel data. Our work addresses this critical gap by providing a dataset of 120,000+ sentence pairs across diverse topics, meticulously extracted and aligned from six major news sources. We introduce a novel hybrid alignment algorithm that combines statistical features, cross-lingual embeddings, and contextual information, achieving 92% alignment accuracy on our test set. Additionally, we implement a multi-stage quality filtering pipeline to ensure translation fidelity. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our dataset improves performance across multiple machine translation systems compared to existing resources. We make our dataset, code, and documentation publicly available, enabling broader research on Bengali language processing and low-resource language technology development.
